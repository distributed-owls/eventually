defmodule Liveness do
  @moduledoc """
  `Liveness` offers the `eventually` higher-order function, which can be used
  to specify liveness properties, or to busy-wait for a particular condition.

  defexception [:message]

  @doc """
  Runs `f` repeatedly until `f` succeeds or the number of `tries` is
  reached.

  Particular runs are separated in time by an interval of `interval`
  milliseconds. The interval period begins when the function begins
  execution. This means that if execution takes longer than `interval`
  milliseconds, the next try will be attempted immediately after `f` returns.

  A function is deemed to have failed if it returns `false` or `nil` (a falsy
  value), or if it crashes (exits, raises, or `:erlang.error`s out).

  If the function returns successfully, its return value becomes the value of
  the call to `eventually`.

  If the function returns a falsy value (`false` or `nil`) upon the last try,
  then the `Liveness` exception is raised.

  If the function raises an exception upon the last try, this exception is
  re-raised by `eventually` with the *original* stacktrace.
